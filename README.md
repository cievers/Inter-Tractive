# Inter-Tractive
This repository contains all the code for the tool and evaluations done for research by Cas Sievers during the graduation project of the Master Computer Science and Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

This specific branch is used to automate tasks on tractograms placed in a specific folder. Selection and editing of tasks can only be done by changing the Unity project and running it from there. The execution of the tasks is highly unstable.

More information and examples of the tool in use coming soon...
